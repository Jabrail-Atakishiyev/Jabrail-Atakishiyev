# 👋 Hi, I'm Jabrail Atakishiyev

🧠 I’m 19 years old and deeply passionate about Data Science. I’m constantly striving to grow and improve in this field.

🎓 I have successfully completed a 5-month Data Science training in LTC Lab. During this time, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (Data analysis and querying)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost)
- Building interactive data applications with Streamlit

🌐 Currently, I continue my education through various online courses:
- Platforms like Coursera, Kaggle, and Udemy help me deepen my skills

🛠 What I’m focused on right now:
- Real-world Data Science projects
- Working with real datasets
- Improving model performance and evaluation
- Developing interactive tools using Streamlit
